# Train your model
python main.py --epochs 20

# Generate submission from trained model
python kaggle_submission.py
```

---

## üìä Competition Workflow

### Step 1: Download Test Data from Kaggle

Download these files from the Kaggle competition page:
- `test.csv` - List of test image IDs
- `test_images.zip` - Test images folder

Place both files in the `cifar10_comp/` folder, then unzip:
```bash
cd cifar10_comp
unzip test_images.zip
```

### Step 2: (Optional) Explore the Data

Open `cifar10_comp.ipynb` and run the data exploration cells to understand:
- What CIFAR-10 classes look like
- Class distribution
- Image statistics

**Note:** This is helpful for understanding the data but not required for training.

### Step 3: Improve Your Model

Modify `model.py` to improve the CNN architecture:
- Add more convolutional layers
- Add BatchNorm layers
- Try different architectures
- Experiment with dropout rates

**Key Tips:**
- The baseline `SimpleCNN` achieves ~50-60% accuracy
- Adding BatchNorm and more layers can boost to 70%+

### Step 4: Add Data Augmentation

Modify the `get_transforms()` function in `main.py` to add augmentations:

```python
transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.3, contrast=0.3, saturation=0.3),
transforms.RandomRotation(15),
transforms.RandomAffine(degrees=0, translate=(0.1, 0.1)),
transforms.RandomGrayscale(p=0.1),
```

**This is CRITICAL!** The test set has augmentations (noise, blur, color shifts).

### Step 5: Train Your Model and Generate Submission

Run the training script:
```bash
python main.py --epochs 20 --lr 0.001 --batch_size 128
```

This will:
1. Train your model on CIFAR-10
2. Save the best model as `best_model.pth`
3. **Automatically generate predictions** on the test set
4. Create `submission.csv` with your predictions

**That's it!** The script does everything for you.

### Step 6: Submit to Kaggle

Upload `submission.csv` to Kaggle and check your score on the leaderboard!

---

### Alternative: Manual Submission Generation

If you need to regenerate predictions without retraining, you can use:

```bash
python kaggle_submission.py
```

**Note:** You'll need to modify `kaggle_submission.py` to use your model architecture if you changed it from the baseline `SimpleCNN`.

---

## üí° Tips for Success

### 1. Data Augmentation is KEY! üîë

The test set has heavy augmentations (noise, blur, color shifts, rotations).

**Add augmentations to your training data** to generalize better:
```python
transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.3, contrast=0.3, saturation=0.3),
transforms.RandomRotation(15),
transforms.RandomAffine(degrees=0, translate=(0.1, 0.1)),
transforms.RandomGrayscale(p=0.1),
transforms.GaussianBlur(kernel_size=3)
```

**Impact:** Can improve score by 10-15%!

### 2. Improve the Model Architecture

The baseline `SimpleCNN` is simple. Try:
- Adding more convolutional blocks (4-6 blocks total)
- Using BatchNorm after Conv layers: `nn.BatchNorm2d(channels)`
- Trying deeper networks (more filters: 256, 512)
- Adding residual connections (ResNet-style)

**Impact:** Can improve score by 5-10%

### 3. Train Longer

The default is 10 epochs. Try training for 20-30 epochs!
- Monitor validation accuracy to avoid overfitting
- Use early stopping if accuracy plateaus

**Impact:** Can improve score by 2-5%

### 4. Experiment with Hyperparameters

Try different values:
- **Learning rate:** 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01
- **Batch size:** 64, 128, 256
- **Optimizer:** Adam, SGD with momentum, AdamW
- **Dropout rate:** 0.3, 0.5, 0.7

**Impact:** Can improve score by 1-3%

### 5. Monitor Overfitting

Watch for signs of overfitting:
- Training accuracy >> Test accuracy
- Test accuracy stops improving

**Solutions:**
- Add more data augmentation
- Increase dropout
- Use weight decay (AdamW optimizer)
- Train for fewer epochs

---

## üèÜ Submission Format

Your `submission.csv` must have this format:
```csv
id,label
0,3
1,8
2,5
...
```

- **id:** Image ID (from test.csv)
- **label:** Predicted class (0-9 for CIFAR-10)

The submission generation scripts handle this automatically!

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "test.csv not found"
Download `test.csv` from Kaggle and place it in the `cifar10_comp/` folder.

### "test_images/ not found"
Download and unzip `test_images.zip` from Kaggle into the `cifar10_comp/` folder.

### "CUDA out of memory"
Reduce batch size:
- In notebook: Change `BATCH_SIZE = 64` (or 32)
- In script: `python main.py --batch_size 64`

### Low Kaggle score despite good training accuracy?
You're overfitting to clean images! **Add more data augmentation.**

### ImportError: No module named 'torch'
Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Model not improving after a few epochs?
- Try a different learning rate
- Add data augmentation
- Make sure BatchNorm is added to your model
- Train longer (20-30 epochs)

---

## üéØ Expected Performance

| Configuration | Validation Acc | Expected Kaggle Score |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Baseline (SimpleCNN, no aug) | ~55% | ~50-55% |
| Baseline + augmentation | ~65% | ~60-65% |
| Improved model + augmentation | ~70-75% | ~68-73% |
| Advanced techniques | ~75-80% | ~73-78% |

*Note: Kaggle test scores are typically 2-5% lower than validation due to augmentations*
